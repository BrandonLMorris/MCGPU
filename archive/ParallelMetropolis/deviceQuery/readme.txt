Sample: Device Query
Minimum spec: SM 1.0

This sample enumerates the properties of the CUDA devices present in the system.


Extra:
Albert added this stuff in on 07 Feb 2014. This will be our device detection. I am just removing some extra methods, changing what it does, and maybe will have all the stuff that is currently displayed added/concatenated to a string so it can be included in output. As is, though, itâ€™s pretty much the demo, with some of the necessary header files included. The code was compiled on Windows, and any other necessary header files were probably set up directly in Visual Studio 2012.
